# TCP Encrypted Chat Application

A chat application is writting in C using TCP sockets. It supports real-time messaging, end-to-end encryption, and file transfer.

This project is developing for the Data Communication and Computer Networks course.

## Features

- **TCP Connection:** Reliable communication between server and client.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Messages are encrypted before sending and decrypted upon receipt.
- **Multi-client Support:** The server handles multiple clients simultaneously using threads.
- **File Transfer:** Supports sending image(.jpg/.png) and audio files (.wav/.mp3) over the socket.

> **NOTE** This project is *actively* being developed. The descriptions refer to the *final version* of the application.
